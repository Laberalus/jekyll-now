My current research interests fall roughly into 3 categories that influence a central theme.
<ol>
  <li> Modeling tumor fitness and evolution
  <li> Elucidating Molecular mechanisms of adaptation to Chromosomal INstability (CIN) &rarr; Cancer as an (Eco)System
  <li> Characterizing tumor heterogeneity of aneuploidy and conferred fitness
</ol>
