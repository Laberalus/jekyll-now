## CANCER AS AN ECOSYSTEM ##
<BR>
My current research interests fall roughly into 3 categories that influence a central theme.
<br>
<ol>
  <li> Modeling tumor fitness and evolution
  <li> Elucidating Molecular mechanisms of adaptation to Chromosomal INstability (CIN)
  <li> Characterizing tumor heterogeneity of aneuploidy and conferred fitness

  Genomic instability is a major hallmark of human cancer. Chromosomal instability (CIN), the propensity for a cell to lose or gain chromosomes, is shown to occur in almost all cancers, though an efficient and reliable method for quantitating the incidence of CIN in tumors has remained elusive. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has traditionally been used to measure loss of specifically labelled chromosomes, however this method offers no method of automation, rendering it impractical for clinical and high-throughput research2. The flux of new next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in recent years has revolutionized our ability to analyze whole genomes. To this end, we plan to develop a method for quantitating CIN at the single-cell resolution using a controllable, reliable CIN model â€“ a Cal51 breast cancer cell line that has been modified with tet-inducible Kif2b shRNA. Kif2b is a kinesin-like motor protein that is involved in mitotic spindle formation and its knockdown in Cal51 cells results in about a rate of chromosome missegregation of about 20%. Once established, the immediate next step is to use this quantitative method to better characterize the mechanisms of action of chemotherapeutic spindle poisons like paclitaxel as well as to begin to characterize relative fitness of specific cellular karyotypes. </p>
