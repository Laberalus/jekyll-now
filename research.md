## CANCER AS AN ECOSYSTEM ##
<BR>
My current research interests fall roughly into 3 categories that influence a central theme.
<br>
<ol>
  <li> Modeling tumor fitness and evolution
  <li> Elucidating Molecular mechanisms of adaptation to Chromosomal INstability (CIN)
  <li> Characterizing tumor heterogeneity of aneuploidy and conferred fitness
