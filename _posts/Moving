title: Moving Blog to GitHub

In an effort to immerse myself in the coding community, I'm moving my preexisting blog at [Bioconjugate.blog] to GitHub.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
