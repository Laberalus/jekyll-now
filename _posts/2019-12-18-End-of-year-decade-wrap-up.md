Well here we are. We're nearing the end of the Twenty-Tens. A decade of increasing global unrest, political polarization, climate change-related weather anomalies, CRISPR-babies, and Taylor Swift!
<br><br>
This year - 2019 - has been a great year for me. And this decade offers a lot to reflect on - within my own personal life and without. I'd like to kick off a new decade with a 'mental flush' of the events that resonated with me as defining the last 10 years. 
<br>
### Notable Events
#### 2010 
<br>
-A 7.0 Mw earthquake devastates the country of Haiti, killing hundreds of thousands.<br>
-The Deepwater Horizon oil rig explodes in the Gulf of Mexico, triggering an environmental crisis.<br> 
-President Obama repeals "Don't Ask, Don't Tell".<br>

#### 2011
