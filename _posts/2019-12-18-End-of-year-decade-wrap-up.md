title: Year- and Decade-End Recap
date: 18 Dec 2019

Well here we are. We're nearing the end of the Twenty-Teens. A decade of increasing global unrest, political polarization, climate change-related weather anomalies, CRISPR-babies, and Taylor Swift!
<br>
This year - 2019 - has been a great year for me. And this decade offers a lot to reflect on - within my own personal life and without.
