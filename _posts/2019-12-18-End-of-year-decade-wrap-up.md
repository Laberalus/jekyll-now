Well here we are. We're nearing the end of the Twenty-Tens. A decade of increasing global unrest, political polarization, climate change-related weather anomalies, CRISPR-babies, and Taylor Swift!
<br><br>
This year - 2019 - has been a great year for me. And this decade offers a lot to reflect on - within my own personal life and without. I'd like to kick off a new decade with a 'mental flush' of the events that resonated with me as defining the last 10 years. 
<br>
### Notable Events
#### 2010 <br>
-A 7.0 Mw earthquake devastates the country of Haiti, killing hundreds of thousands.<br>
-The Deepwater Horizon oil rig explodes in the Gulf of Mexico, triggering an environmental crisis.<br> 
-President Obama repeals "Don't Ask, Don't Tell".<br>

#### 2011<br>
-World population exceeds 7 billion.<br>
-Osama bin Laden killed by U.S. Special Forces in Pakistan. <br>
-Egyptian revolution begins a series of protests and revolutions in what is referred to as the "Arab Spring".<br>

#### 2012
<br>
-[CRISPR can be used for *targeted* DNA cleavage.](https://github.com/andrewrlynch/andrewrlynch.github.io/blob/master/Jinek-et-al.-2012.pdf)
-[Higgs boson is detected at CERN.](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/science/cern-physicists-may-have-discovered-higgs-boson-particle.html)<br>
-The whole Kony 2012 thing.
-The Mayan/Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar ends (21 December). Apocalypse begins. <br>
