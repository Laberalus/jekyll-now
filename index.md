# Hi. 

My name is Andrew Lynch. I'm a scientist studying cancer and currently a PhD candidate in Cell and Molecular Pathology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I employ genomics, stochastic modeling, and cell biology to study the role of chromosomal instability (CIN) and aneuploidy in the evolution of tumors and the progression of cancer.

### Blog posts

Prior to setting up shop on a github domain, I wrote intermittently on science literacy, policy, etc. on my blog <a href = "https://bioconjugate.blog">*The Bioconjugate*</a>. These posts were somewhat exploratory in nature. Really figuring out what it is I'm interested in and what my *angle* is. But who needs angles these days? One can expect to find here a smattering of thoughts. . .primarily science related, intermittently opining. 

### Outside of science...

I'm an avid reader of most things - largely science fiction and fantasy. I absolutely love all things Tolkien. I'll keep a [reading list here](https://andrewrlynch.github.io/reading-list/), for my own purposes and also for anyone interested. I've also reviewed books in the past. This is not so much to *rate* them, but to offer a discussion for those that may be looking for a good read. I may leave some of that here.

Getting out in nature has always kept me grounded and provided solace from stress at various points of my life (graduate school included). Camping is one of the easiest, cheapest, most sustainable ways to have fun and travel. [Nature and landscape photography](https://andrewrlynch.github.io/photography/) has been a transient hobby throughout my life. 

Cooking has historically provided an avenue for procrastination. I continue this practice to this day. I'll leave some [recipes](https://andrewrlynch.github.io/recipes/).
