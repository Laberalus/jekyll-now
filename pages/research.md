## Chromosomal Instability in the Progression of Human Cancer
  <p style="text-align:justify">
Genomic instability is a major hallmark of human cancer. Chromosomal instability (CIN), the propensity for a cell to lose or gain chromosomes, occurs at varying rates in upwards of 90% of cancers. The presence of CIN is associated with advanced clinical features and worse patient prognosis. However, high "levels" of CIN are tumor inhibiting. Despite its clinical significance, an efficient and quantitative method for quantifyng the "levels" of CIN *in vivo* does not exist.

### Computational modeling of nCIN in tumor evolution and improving *in vivo* measures

  CIN is a dynamic process that occurs over many cellular divisions. This makes its study in human tumors—which cannot be constantly monitored—difficult. As such, the precise association between a tumor's intrinsic level of CIN—its rate of chromosome mis-segregation—and intratumoral karyotype diversity remain ambiguous. Modeling and parameterization of the factors that contribute to karyotype diversity—time, mis-segregation rate, and selective pressure—enables the simulation of the process of CIN. The outcomes of these simulations can be compared to tumor-derived single cell sequencing datasets that, while only providing a snapshot in time, can provide a great deal of information on the karyotypic diversity of the tumor.
